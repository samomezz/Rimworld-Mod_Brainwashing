Yes this source code is all in one file, don't worry about it.

# What does this mod add? 
1 new Building:
## Propaganda speaker 
Passively convert pawns (to the primary ideology of your faction) by pumping propaganda directly into their ears! Once per day per pawn, this speaker will give a tiny boost towards your ideology to all pawns that come near enough to listen.
	
1 new trait:
## Propaganda resistant trait 
Pawns with this trait will be unhappy when subjected to propaganda. Proportionate to their intellectual skill, they will also be less swayed by it.
	
1 new surgery involving 3 new ingredients:
## Brainwashers
Brainwasher Mk.'s 1-3—Used in brainwashing surgery, produced at machining tables. Each increase in Mk# increases the safety of the operation.

## Surgical brainwashing 
Physically wash the brain til it squeaks. Rewire their brain so they like your ideas; it's good fun for the whole family! Except for those pawns who receive side effects. Requires medical and intellectual skill of 6. Side effects and other adverse reactions may include **(incidence rates listed are for Mk1; Mk2 and 3 are respectively 1.41x & 1.73x safer)**:
	-Brain cancer (Only occurs when using Mk.1 brainwashers at a rate of 1 in 200)
	-Partial to complete memory loss—(incidence of 1 in 100) Pawn may forget everyone and everything they ever knew including their faction, many skills, and their personality. Pawns are known to rip their clothes off in fear when this occurs.
	-Additionally, 1 of the following may occur:
		-Blindness (1 in 125)
		-Bliss Lobotomy (1 in 250)
		-Catatonic breakdown (1 in 250)
		-Dementia (1 in 250)
		-Psychically dead (1 in 4)
		-Heatstroke (1 in 4)
		-Morning sickness (2 in 9)

		-Manhunter (1 in 250)
		-Permanent manhunter (1 in 250)
		-Panic Flee (1 in 250)
		-Social fight the surgeon (1 in 250)
		-Wander Psychotic (1 in 4)
		-Wander Sad (1 in 4)
	-Worry not though, there is a **3 in 7 chance your pawn will be perfectly fine** and won't have even noticed they were brainwashed (3 in 4)
